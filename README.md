# 🛒 Sales Insights Analysis

This project is a simple and clear data analysis of retail sales data.  
I explored monthly revenue trends, top products, high-performing regions, and customer spending patterns using Python.  
The goal is to understand how sales behave over time and what drives the most revenue.
